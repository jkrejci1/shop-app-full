# shop-app-full
The full repository with both the front and back end of my shop app project using the MERN Stack. I created this to practice my skills with React by interacting with a MongoDB database to display items that are on the shop website, and to practice authentication using React. https://shop-app-practice-krejci.azurewebsites.net/
